### ✅ JSON Tree Viewer Implementation
**Date:** 2025-10-16 07:09 UTC  
**Component:** `src/components/json-tree-viewer.tsx`  
**Integration:** `src/components/db-lists.tsx`

#### What Was Done:
- Created new `JsonTreeViewer` component that renders JSON data as an interactive collapsible tree
- Replaced basic `<pre>` tag JSON display with professional tree-based UI
- **NO new dependencies** - uses only React, Tailwind CSS, and lucide-react (already available)

#### Features:
1. **Collapsible/Expandable Nodes**
   - Click chevron to expand/collapse objects and arrays
   - Auto-expands first 2 levels for better UX
   - Shows item/key count when collapsed

2. **Syntax Highlighting via Color-Coding**
   - Keys: Purple (`text-purple-600`)
   - Strings: Red (`text-red-600`)
   - Numbers: Emerald (`text-emerald-600`)
   - Booleans: Blue (`text-blue-600`)
   - Null: Amber (`text-amber-600`)
   - Muted colors for dark mode support

3. **Enhanced Copy Functionality**
   - "Copy All" button for entire JSON (top-right)
   - Individual value copy on hover (mini copy icon on string values)
   - 1.5s feedback animation for both actions

4. **Visual Improvements**
   - Proper indentation with left border guide for nested structures
   - Monospace font (font-mono) for data accuracy
   - Better contrast with card background
   - Responsive layout that works on mobile

#### Technical Details:
- Recursive component design for arbitrary nesting depth
- TypeScript type-safe JSON value handling
- Memoized data processing to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Uses existing Tailwind utility classes for styling

#### Before/After:
**Before:** Yellow background, plain text, no structure indication  
**After:** Colored syntax, expandable tree, clear hierarchy, professional appearance
